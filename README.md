# üöÄ Deploying .NET Microservices to Kubernetes and Azure with CI/CD
This project demonstrates how to containerize, deploy, and automate the deployment of .NET microservices using Docker, Kubernetes, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Container Registry (ACR), and CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps and GitHub.

It serves as a hands-on guide for building, testing, and deploying multi-container microservice applications from local environments to cloud-native infrastructure, with support for zero-downtime deployments and full CI/CD automation.

## üß© Project Structure ‚Äì Microservices Overview
This solution consists of three core microservices:

### 1. Shopping.Client (MVC Web App)
- ASP.NET MVC application that consumes the Shopping API.
- Initially built as a standalone web app with embedded data.
- Later containerized using Docker and deployed to:
  - Docker Hub
  - Azure Web App for Containers
  - Kubernetes (local & cloud via AKS)

### 2. Shopping.API
- ASP.NET Web API microservice for managing product data.
- Uses MongoDB for data persistence.
- Containerized and deployed via:
  - Docker Compose
  - Azure Container Registry (ACR)
  - Kubernetes (local & cloud)

### 3. MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
- Pulled from the official Docker Hub image.
- Used as a backend database for the Shopping.API service.
- Connected and composed with the API through Docker and Kubernetes.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Native & Kubernetes Workflow
This project takes your services through the full cloud-native lifecycle:

‚úÖ Create Dockerfiles for each service

‚úÖ Compose containers locally using Docker Compose

‚úÖ Deploy containers to local Kubernetes cluster

‚úÖ Push Docker images to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

‚úÖ Deploy microservices to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

‚úÖ Enable zero-downtime deployments using Kubernetes features

‚úÖ Automate deployment with CI/CD pipelines via Azure DevOps
